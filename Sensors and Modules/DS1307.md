Connect DS1307 to I2C bus 1, ``0x68`` address will be available on bus I2C 1 which can be scanned by [i2cdetect](https://github.com/TranPhucVinh/Linux-Shell/blob/master/Physical%20layer/I2C.md#i2c-tools).

To read by ``hwclock`` command, the kernel driver specified for the used RTC must be loaded.

For DS1307, a kernel driver is already installed (``/lib/modules/5.15.32-v7+/kernel/drivers/rtc/rtc-ds1307.ko``) for DS1307 hardware module to use.

Before assigning kernel module ``rtc-ds1307`` to I2C bus 1, change mode of I2C bus to allow writing to ``new_device``: ``sudo chmod 777 /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-1/new_device``.

Then assign kernel module ``rtc-ds1307`` (presented by ``ds1307`` argument) to I2C bus 1:

```sh
sudo echo ds1307 0x68 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-1/new_device
```

After assigning, kernel module ``rtc_ds1307`` will be available:

```sh
pi@raspberrypi:$ lsmod|grep 1307
rtc_ds1307             28672  0
regmap_i2c             16384  1 rtc_ds1307
```

Then read by ``hwclock`` command (must run with ``sudo``): ``sudo hwclock -r``
